DNSLookup
===========

A CFC for retrieving DNS record type values from a supplied domain.

The "lookup" functions cover DNS types listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types.

Formatting of data has been applied to known outputs that could be tested, so some arrays may contain a string of multiple values that would still need to be parsed.
